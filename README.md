 <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>When i completed this project, i feel more confident working with Flex-Box and aplying responsive dessign. I understand what type of html tags are supossed to be used in the navigation bar (i.e. nav, ul, li and a tags). Also I learned how to use Font Awesome Icons and that sometimes using Bootstrap can be useful, but you need to be carefull, because makes a site look generic<p>
